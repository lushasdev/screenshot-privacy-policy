        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="effective-date"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 13, 2025</p>
        
        <p>yorocobu LLC ("we," "our," or "us") operates the Screenshot to Calendar & Notes mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our App.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Please read this privacy policy carefully.</strong> If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not use the App.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        
        <h3>1.1 Personal Information</h3>
        <p>We do not collect traditional personal information such as your name, email address, or phone number unless you voluntarily provide it to us (e.g., when contacting support).</p>
        
        <h3>1.2 Device and Usage Information</h3>
        <p>When you use our App, we may automatically collect certain information, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device type, operating system version, unique device identifiers</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> App features used, interaction frequency, crash reports, and performance data</li>
            <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> App preferences and settings stored locally on your device</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.3 Photo and Screenshot Data</h3>
        <p>Our App accesses your device's photo library and screenshots for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Screenshot Detection:</strong> The App scans for new screenshots to extract tasks and calendar events</li>
            <li><strong>Image Processing:</strong> Screenshots are processed using AI to identify text, dates, and actionable items</li>
            <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> Image analysis occurs primarily on your device</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="highlight">Important: Your photos and screenshots are processed locally on your device whenever possible. When cloud processing is necessary (for advanced AI features), images are sent securely to our third-party AI service provider and are not stored permanently.</p>

        <h3>1.4 Calendar Data</h3>
        <p>With your permission, the App accesses your device calendar to:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>Sync due dates and reminders</li>
            <li>Read existing calendar entries to avoid duplicates</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.5 Notification Data</h3>
        <p>We use device notifications to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Alert you when new screenshots are detected</li>
            <li>Remind you of upcoming tasks and deadlines</li>
            <li>Notify you when tasks are synced to your calendar</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Provide Core Functionality:</strong> Extract tasks and events from screenshots, create calendar entries, and manage your to-do list</li>
            <li><strong>Improve the App:</strong> Analyze usage patterns to enhance features and fix bugs</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>3.2 Analytics and Crash Reporting</h3>
        <p>We may use third-party analytics services to help us understand how users interact with the App and to identify crashes or errors. These services may collect:</p>

            <li>Device information and operating system details</li>
            <li>App usage statistics</li>
            <li>Crash logs and error reports</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        
        <h3>4.1 Local Storage</h3>
        <p>Most of your data, including extracted tasks and calendar information, is stored locally on your device. This data remains on your device and is not transmitted to our servers unless you use cloud-dependent features.</p>

        <h3>4.2 Security Measures</h3>
        <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your information, including:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>Limited data retention policies</li>

        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        
        <p>We retain your information only as long as necessary to provide the App's functionality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Data:</strong> Tasks and calendar entries remain on your device until you delete them</li>
            <li><strong>AI Processing:</strong> Screenshots sent to AI services are processed immediately and not stored long-term</li>
            <li><strong>Crash Reports:</strong> Retained for up to 90 days for debugging purposes</li>
        </ul>
